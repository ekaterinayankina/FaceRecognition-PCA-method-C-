# FaceRecognition-PCA-method-C-
PCA-method Face Recognition Program on C#

This program for detecting and recognizing a person from a video camera in real time by analyzing the main components. 

The goal of the work was to simplify the task of identifying a person by automating the process of detecting and recognizing faces
in a video stream in real time. 
Special attention was paid to the development of the method of main components, the speed and quality of image recognition. 
The methodology and software implementation of the automatic addition of a set of unique human data to the database from the video stream
in real time was also developed, which makes it possible to simplify and speed up the process of expanding the database.

The implementation of the software was based on the .NET Framework using C# and the Microsoft Visual Studio 2015 development environment.
